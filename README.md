## Project Description
ThreeD Garden is an app written in JavaScript (TypeScript) for intense ThreeJS WebGL 3D rendering, using the React/Next (or Vue/Nuxt, or Vanilla/Vite) frameworks, using @react-three libraries. ThreeD Garden is exportable as a standalone CommonJS app, and as a WordPress plugin. 'threed-garden' is a functioning, low-dependency app, a package supporting a monorepo of workspaces that utilize/depend on 'ThreeJS, WebGL, Vite React, Vue, TypeScript, React-Three-Fiber, GraphQL', in active development.
